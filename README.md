This is a super simple CRUD app I made to experiment with Cloudflare Workers (similar to AWS Lambda), 
and [HonoJS](https://hono.dev/), which is a serverless JavaScript framework. Gatsby source is in `src/` and the Hono router is in `router/`.

Post using an alias and a 250 character message. View posts in order by date (assuming the DB is hooked up).
